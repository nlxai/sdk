## Accessing the ConversationHandler

You can access the `ConversationHandler` in two main ways:

### From the Touchpoint Instance

When you initialize Touchpoint UI using the `create` method, it returns a `TouchpointInstance` object. This object contains the `conversationHandler`.

```touchpointui
const touchpointOptions = {
  config: {
    applicationUrl: "YOUR_APPLICATION_URL",
    headers: { "nlx-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY" },
    languageCode: "en-US",
  },
  // Other Touchpoint UI options
};

const touchpoint = await create(touchpointOptions);
const conversationHandler = touchpoint.conversationHandler;
// Now you can use conversationHandler methods
// Make it globally accessible for other script tags or inline event handlers
window.myAppGlobalConversationHandler = conversationHandler;
```

### From Custom Modality Components

When building [Custom Modality Components](/guide-building-custom-components), the `conversationHandler` is passed as a prop to your component, allowing seamless interaction with the ongoing conversation.

**Component example**

```touchpointui
const MyCustomButtonComponent = ({ data, conversationHandler }) => {
  const myButton = html`
  <TextButton
    label="My Button"
    Icon=${Icons.ArrowForward}
    onClick="${() => {
      conversationHandler.sendChoice(data.buttonId);
    }}}"
  />`;
  return myButton;
};
```

To use this component, you would register it in the `modalityComponents` option when creating the Touchpoint instance.

## Sending Messages and Data

The `ConversationHandler` provides several methods to send information to your NLX application. Most of these methods allow an optional `context` object as the second argument, enabling you to pass context variables to NLX to use in your flows.

ðŸ’¡ In order to use the context variables from Touchpoint in your flow, you need to define each variable as a [Context Variable](https://docs.nlx.ai/platform/build/resources/context-variables) in your NLX workspace. If the context variable is not configured within NLX, the value will not be available in the Flow.

### `sendText(text, context?)`

Use `sendText` to send a free-form text message from the user. This is typically used when your NLX flow expects a textual response, such as capturing a name, email, or any other information for a slot that accepts open-ended input.

**When to use:**

- Responding to an open-ended question from the bot.
- Filling a slot that expects arbitrary text input.

```js
// Assuming 'conversationHandler' is obtained
conversationHandler.sendText("Yes, I'd like to know more about your services.");

// Sending text with context
conversationHandler.sendText("My email is user@example.com", {
  pageSection: "pricingInquiry",
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
});
```

### `sendFlow(flowId, context?)`

Use `sendFlow` to programmatically trigger a specific flow within your NLX application. This is useful for starting the conversation at a particular point or guiding it based on user actions outside the chat interface (e.g., clicking a "Track Order" button on your website).

**When to use:**

- Starting a conversation with a specific purpose (e.g., "CheckOrderStatus").
- Responding to user interactions on your webpage that map to a defined flow.
- Allowing custom components to direct the conversation flow.

```js
// Assuming 'conversationHandler' is obtained
conversationHandler.sendFlow("RequestTechnicalSupport");

// Sending an flow with context variables
conversationHandler.sendFlow("ViewProductDetails", {
  productId: "PROD12345",
  category: "electronics",
});
```

### `sendWelcomeFlow(context?)`

Use `sendWelcomeFlow` to initiate the conversation with the default welcome flow configured in your NLX application. This is automatically called by Touchpoint UI by default when the chat opens (unless `initializeConversation` is overridden), but you can call it manually to restart or refresh the conversation. You can also pass `context` variables to personalize the welcome experience.

**When to use:**

- Starting the conversation when Touchpoint is first opened.
- Providing a "start over" functionality.
- Sending initial context data (like user status or page information) at the beginning of a conversation.

```js
// Assuming 'conversationHandler' is obtained

// Simple welcome flow
conversationHandler.sendWelcomeFlow();

// Welcome flow with initial context
conversationHandler.sendWelcomeFlow({
  userLoggedIn: true,
  entryPoint: "ProductPageWelcome",
  languagePreference: "es-MX",
});
```

Refer to the [Launching with Context guide](/guide-custom-launch) for more on customizing initial interactions.

### `sendChoice(choiceId, context?)`

Use `sendChoice` when the user selects an option from a list of choices presented by the NLX application. These choices might appear as quick replies, buttons in a card, or items in a carousel. The `choiceId` must match one of the `choiceId`s provided by the bot in a previous message.

**When to use:**

- User clicks a quick reply button.
- User selects an item from a [carousel](/touchpoint-carousel) or list that has an associated `choiceId`.
- Responding to a user-choice node that expects a 'label' or 'id' response.

```touchpointui
const MyCustomButtonComponent = ({ data, conversationHandler }) => {
  const myButton = html`<TextButton
    label="My Button"
    Icon=${Icons.ArrowForward}
    onClick="${() => {
      conversationHandler.sendChoice(data.buttonId);
    }}}"
  />`;
  return myButton;
};
```

### `sendSlots(slots, context?)`

Use `sendSlots` to send a collection of slot values to NLX. This is highly useful for providing multiple pieces of information at once, such as filling a form.

Provide an object where keys are the **slot names** (as defined in your NLX Application's "Attached Slots" section for an Flow, or as slot collector node names) and values are the data for those slots.

**When to use:**

- Submitting data from a form within a custom component or your webpage.
- Providing multiple pieces of information gathered through a custom UI.

```js
// Assuming 'conversationHandler' is obtained
// Slot names ('FirstName', 'ProductInterest') must match those in your NLX configuration.
conversationHandler.sendSlots({
  FirstName: "Alex",
  LastName: "Rivera",
  ProductInterest: "Solar Panels",
});

// Sending slots with context
conversationHandler.sendSlots(
  { EmailAddress: "alex.rivera@email.com", ZipCode: "90210" },
  { formName: "leadCaptureForm" },
);
```

### `sendStructured(request, context?)`

`sendStructured` is used for sending a combination of an flow, choice, and/or slots in a single request. This is useful for more complex interactions where multiple pieces of data need to be conveyed simultaneously.

Refer to the [Headless API Reference (`StructuredRequest` type)](/headless-api-reference#interfacesconversationhandlermd) for details on the `request` object structure.

```js
// Assuming 'conversationHandler' is obtained
conversationHandler.sendStructured(
  {
    flowId: "FinalizeOrderFlow", // Trigger a specific flow
    slots: {
      // Provide slot data
      PaymentMethod: "CreditCard",
      ShippingPreference: "Express",
    },
    // choiceId: "confirm_action" // Optionally, also send a choiceId
  },
  { currentCartValue: 150.75 }, // Send along some context
);
```
