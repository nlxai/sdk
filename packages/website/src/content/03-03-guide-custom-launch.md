## Context Variables in NLX and Touchpoint

Context Variables within NLX and Touchpoint allow you pass 'context' about the user's interaction and state from Touchpoint to NLX.

ðŸ’¡ In order to use the context variables from Touchpoint in your flow, you need to define each variable as a [Context Variable](https://docs.nlx.ai/platform/build/resources/context-variables) in your NLX workspace. If the context variable is not configured within NLX, the value will not be available in the Flow.

## Passing Initial Data with `initialContext`

The `initialContext` option in your Touchpoint UI configuration is the simplest way to send data to your NLX application when a conversation starts. `initialContext` works all input modes: text, voice, and voiceMini.

The `initialContext` object accepts key-value pairs, which are then available as [Context Variables](https://docs.nlx.ai/platform/build/resources/context-variables#use-a-context-variable) within your NLX flows.

**When to use `initialContext`:**

- You need to pass user details, page information, or any other relevant data at the beginning of the conversation.
- You don't need custom JavaScript logic to run on launch, just data passing.
- You want a straightforward way to provide context for text, voice, or voiceMini interactions from the start.

```touchpointui
const touchpoint = await create({
  config: {
    applicationUrl: "YOUR_APPLICATION_URL",
    headers: { "nlx-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY" },
    languageCode: "en-US",
    // userId is required if input is "voice" or "voiceMini"
    userId: crypto.randomUUID(),
  },
  // userTier and current page must be defined as context variables in your NLX workspace
  initialContext: {
    userTier: "gold",
    currentPage: "/products/item123",
  },
  // input: "text", // or "voice", "voiceMini"
});
```

If you also provide a custom `initializeConversation` function (see below), the `initialContext` object will be passed as the second argument to that function.

## Customizing Initialization Logic with `initializeConversation`

For more advanced scenarios where you need to execute custom JavaScript logic when the Touchpoint UI launches, you can use the `initializeConversation` function.

ðŸ’¡ `initializeConversation` **only works** for `text` input mode. Your function is responsible for initiating the conversation (e.g., by calling `handler.sendWelcomeFlow()` or `handler.sendFlow()`).

**When to use `initializeConversation`:**

- You need to conditionally decide which flow to send based on application state.
- You want to perform actions like logging, analytics tracking, or API calls before the first message is sent.
- You need to implement custom setup logic for specific input modes.

### Initialization Function Signature

The `initializeConversation` function receives the [`ConversationHandler`](/touchpoint-ui-ConversationHandler) instance and any `initialContext` you provided in the configuration:

```typescript
type InitializeConversation = (
  conversationHandler: ConversationHandler,
  initialContext?: Record<string, any>, // Context from TouchpointConfiguration.initialContext
) => void;
```

The `ConversationHandler` provides methods like:
| Method | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sendWelcomeFlow(context?)` | Sends the default welcome Flow. The `context` argument here will merge with or override the `initialContext` passed to the function. |
| `sendFlow(flowId, context?)`| Sends a specific Flow. The `context` argument here will merge with or override the `initialContext` passed to the function. |

## Examples

### 1. Sending User Information via `initialContext` (Recommended for Data Passing)

This example demonstrates passing `firstName` and `userTier`. These need to be defined as Context Variables in your NLX Workspace to be usable in your flows. This approach works for text, voice, and voiceMini.

```touchpointui
const touchpoint = await create({
  config: {
    applicationUrl: "YOUR_APPLICATION_URL",
    headers: { "nlx-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY" },
    languageCode: "en-US",
    userId: crypto.randomUUID(), // Required for voice
  },
  // userTier and firstName must be defined as context variables in your NLX workspace
  initialContext: {
    firstName: "David",
    userTier: "premium",
  },
  // input: "text", // Or "voice", "voiceMini"
});
```

### 2. Launching with a Custom Flow Using `initializeConversation`

The specific flow (`CheckOrderStatus`) must be defined in your NLX application. `userSource`, `pageUrl`, all must be defined as context variables in your NLX workspace.

```touchpointui
const initializeWithCustomFlow = (conversationHandler) => {
  // userSource and pageUrl must be defined as context variables in your NLX workspace
  const context = {
    userSource: "website",
    pageUrl: window.location.href
  }
  // Send a specific Flow with the context
  conversationHandler.sendFlow("CheckOrderStatus", context);
};

const touchpoint = await create({
  config: {
    applicationUrl: "YOUR_APPLICATION_URL",
    headers: { "nlx-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY" },
    languageCode: "en-US",
  },
  initializeConversation: initializeWithCustomFlow,
  input: "text", // This custom function will run for any input mode
});
```
